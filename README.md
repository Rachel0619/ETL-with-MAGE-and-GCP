## Data Engineering Zoomcamp - Week 2

Welcome to DE Zoomcamp with Mage! 

Mage is an open-source, hybrid framework for transforming and integrating data. ✨

In this module, you'll learn how to use the Mage platform to author and share _magical_ data pipelines. This will all be covered in the course, but if you'd like to learn a bit more about Mage, check out our docs [here](https://docs.mage.ai/introduction/overview).

## Let's get started

This repo contains a Docker Compose template for getting started with a new Mage project. It requires Docker to be installed locally. If Docker is not installed, please follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). 

You can start by cloning the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-zoomcamp.git mage-zoomcamp
```

Navigate to the repo:

```bash
cd mage-data-engineering-zoomcamp
```

Rename `dev.env` to simply `.env`— this will _ensure_ the file is not committed to Git by accident, since it _will_ contain credentials in the future.

Now, let's build the container

```bash
docker compose build
```

Finally, start the Docker container:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Now, navigate to http://localhost:6789 in your browser! Voila! You're ready to get started with the course. 

### What just happened?

We just initialized a new mage repository. It will be present in your project under the name `magic-zoomcamp`. If you changed the varable `PROJECT_NAME` in the `.env` file, it will be named whatever you set it to.

This repository should have the following structure:

```
.
├── mage_data
│   └── magic-zoomcamp
├── magic-zoomcamp
│   ├── __pycache__
│   ├── charts
│   ├── custom
│   ├── data_exporters
│   ├── data_loaders
│   ├── dbt
│   ├── extensions
│   ├── interactions
│   ├── pipelines
│   ├── scratchpads
│   ├── transformers
│   ├── utils
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── io_config.yaml
│   ├── metadata.yaml
│   └── requirements.txt
├── Dockerfile
├── README.md
├── dev.env
├── docker-compose.yml
└── requirements.txt
```

## Solutions

If you're looking for the solutions, you can take a look at the `solutions` branch of this repo. 

```bash
git checkout solutions
```

Running `docker compose up` on the solutions branch will start the container with the solutions loaded. _Note: this will overwrite the files in your local repo. Be sure to commit your files to a separate branch if you'd like to save your work._
